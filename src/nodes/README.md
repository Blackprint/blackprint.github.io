This folder contains example node element to be registered into Blackprint. Some interface registration where it's interfaced the Blackprint engine into visual nodes.

This is where the [js file control the template](https://github.com/ScarletsFiction/ScarletsFrame/wiki/Component) and being registered as new Blackprint node. The simple explanation is a place where the JavaScript interact with the HTML and vice versa.<br>
Then we can register a Blackprint handler for it later.

> ScarletsFrame control the DOM element system, and Blackprint control your node flow.
> So you can create your own handler on Blackprint and control for every node element.
