## Views routing directory
This directory will be used for page routing.

`body.sf` will be appended to `document.body` because it's using `append-to-body` attribute on the `html` section, and `<vw-ground>` is the main page container.

The first page will be targeted into `/src/routes/+vw-ground/index.sf`.
