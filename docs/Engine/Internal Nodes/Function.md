## Function Node
Function node can be used for grouping your nodes into a single nodes and also be used as a function. Each created node is a different Blackprint instance but does share the function/variable of the main instance. The function node also have different variable node feature:

1. **Public variable**: shared with other function node and the instance outside of the function
2. **Shared variable**: shared with other function node but not shared with the instance
3. **Private variable**: only can be accessed inside each function, and each function with the same variable name will have different value
