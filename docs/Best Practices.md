## Best practices
Best practice is a standard or set of guidelines that represent the efficient and effective way to produce an optimal result. This documentation will only cover best practice with Blackprint, it's also recommended to follow best practice for the programming language that you're going to use. By following the best practices you can avoid common vulnerability and decrease complicated code in the future.

Blackprint's guidelines may be updated when there are new feature for Blackprint or we found a best way to do something.
